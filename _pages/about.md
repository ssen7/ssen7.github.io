I am Saurav, a masters of data science student at the [Data Science Institute, University of Virginia](https://dsi.virginia.edu). 

I come from a web development background where I helped a renowned bank in Asia replace their internal legacy web interface with flexible cloud based web services using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). While there, I developed systems that were interfaces for data storage and retrieval which was in turn used for analytics to streamline processes and reduce risk. This turned me on to how data can be a valuable commodity and initiated my journey into data science.

I am motivated by the idea of building accessible pieces of technology that assist us in our daily lives, by helping us invest smarter, learn better and other myriad of uses. I hope to use the cutting edge of technology to build such systems.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
